## Introduction

Zamrud Chain is a minimalist blockchain prototype implemented using Go. It leverages the hexagonal architecture (also known as the Ports & Adapters pattern) to create a clean separation of concerns, ensuring that the core logic of our blockchain remains independent of external factors.
